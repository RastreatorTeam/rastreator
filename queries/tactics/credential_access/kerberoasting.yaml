statement:
  table: >-
    match (u:User{enabled:true, domain:'RAS-DOMAIN', hasspn:true})
    unwind u.serviceprincipalnames as spn
    return distinct u.name, spn
    order by u.name asc, spn
nextsteps:
  rt:
    - Request TGS for all user SPNs and crack them.
  bt:
    - Ensure all service accounts have long and complex passwords and rotate them periodically.
    - Eliminate use of insecure protocols in Kerberos removing RC4 encryption.
    - Use sMSA or gMSA for automatic password management.
    - Create service account honeypots.
