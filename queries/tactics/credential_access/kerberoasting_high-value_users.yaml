description: Get high-value users with SPNs (kerberoasting).
statement:
  main: >-
    match (u:User{enabled:true, domain:'RAS-DOMAIN', hasspn:true})-[:MemberOf*1..]->(g:Group{highvalue:true, domain:'RAS-DOMAIN'})
    unwind u.serviceprincipalnames as spn
    return distinct u.name as Name, spn
    order by Name asc, spn asc
  count:
    - return .* order/return distinct u.name as Name, count(distinct spn) as Count order
    - order .*/order by Count desc, Name asc
nextsteps:
  rt:
    - Request TGS for all user SPNs and crack them.
  bt:
    - Ensure all service accounts have long and complex passwords and rotate them periodically.
    - Eliminate use of insecure protocols in Kerberos removing RC4 encryption.
    - Use sMSA or gMSA for automatic password management.
    - Create service account honeypots.
