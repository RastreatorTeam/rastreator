description: Get ghost SPNs (constrained delegation pointing to non-existent SPNs).
statement:
  table: >-
    match (n{enabled:true, domain:'RAS-DOMAIN'})
    unwind n.serviceprincipalnames as uspn
    with collect(distinct split(split(toUpper(uspn), "/")[1], ":")[0]) as dspn
    match (n{enabled:true, domain:'RAS-DOMAIN'})
    unwind n.allowedtodelegate as uatd
    with dspn, collect(uatd) as catd
    unwind [atd in catd where not split(split(toUpper(atd), "/")[1], ":")[0] in dspn] as spn
    return distinct toUpper(spn) as ghostspn order by ghostspn

nextsteps:
  rt:
    - Get admin to the computer with constrained delegation that uses ghost SPNs.
    - Get at least WriteSPN to the computer you want to compromise.
  bt:
    - Remove ghost SPNs from constrained delegation configurations.
