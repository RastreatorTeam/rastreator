nextsteps:
  rt:
    - If end node is a Computer, impersonate any domain user on it (RBCD attack).
    - If end node is a Computer, read the password of the local administrator.
    - If end node is a Computer, perform an SPN-jacking attack.
    - If end node is a Domain, get any password hash on the domain.
    - If end node is a GPO, perform an immediate scheduled task.
    - If end node is a Group, add a user.
    - If end node is a User or Computer, and AD CS is enabled, add "key credentials" to the attribute msDS-KeyCredentialLink.
    - If end node is a User, execute a custom script at user logon.
    - If end node is a User, perform a targeted kerberoasting attack.
    - If end node is a User, read the password of the Group Managed Service Account.
    - If end node is a User, reset its password.
