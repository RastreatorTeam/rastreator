    match p=(n)-[:MemberOf*1..]->(g:Group{highvalue:true})
    with nodes(p) as np
    unwind np as unp
    with collect(distinct unp) as dunp
    match p=(n)-[r]->(g:GPO)
    where not n in dunp
    unwind labels(n) as type
    return distinct type, n.name, g.name
    order by type, n.name, g.name
