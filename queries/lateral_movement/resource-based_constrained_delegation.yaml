    match (n)-[:AddAllowedToAct|AllowedToAct]->(c:Computer{enabled:true})
    unwind labels(n) as type
    return distinct type, n.name, type(r), c.name
    order by type, n.name, type(r), c.name
nextsteps:
  rt:
    - Compromise them.
    - Perform impersonation attacks.
  bt:
    - Check security descriptors.
