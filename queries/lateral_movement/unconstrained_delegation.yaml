    match (n)
    where n.enabled = true and n.unconstraineddelegation = true and not (n)-[:MemberOf]->(:Group{name:'RAS-DC@RAS-DOMAIN'})
    unwind labels(n) as type
    unwind n.serviceprincipalnames as spn

nextsteps:
  rt:
    - Compromise them.
    - Dump TGTs from memory.
    - Perform lateral movement.
  bt:
    - Evaluate the use of resource-based constrained delegation.
