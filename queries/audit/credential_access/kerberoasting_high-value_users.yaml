description: Get high-value users with SPNs (kerberoasting).
statement:
  table: >-
    match (u:User{enabled:true, domain:'RAS-DOMAIN', hasspn:true})-[:MemberOf*1..]->(g:Group{highvalue:true, domain:'RAS-DOMAIN'})
    unwind u.serviceprincipalnames as spn
    return distinct u.name, spn
    order by u.name asc, spn
nextsteps:
  rt:
    - Request TGS for all user SPNs and crack them.
  bt:
    - Ensure all service accounts have long and complex passwords and rotate them periodically.
    - Eliminate the use of insecure protocols in Kerberos removing RC4 encryption.
    - Create service account honeypots.
